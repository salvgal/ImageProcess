# Image Processing toolkit (Digital image processing)

This projects execute filter and mathematical transformation on images, taken as input as array of integers that represents the pixels attributes.
These tools are build in both Java and C++11.
Three projects in three different folders:

Morphology operations : Taken as input a 2Darray representig an image, load image and apply morphology operations as dilation, erosion, opening, and closing. Print the images with the filters applied as output.

K-Curvature: Taken as input a 2Darray representig an image, load image and calculate the k-curvature, using the k chord length method. Print the images with the filters applied as output.

K Chord Length:  Taken as input a 2Darray representig an image, load image and using the k chord length method, find the chord distance. Print the images as output.
